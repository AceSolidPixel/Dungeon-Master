# Dungeon-Master
Create a program that allows a user to play a dungeon maze game. Use the UML diagram
on the next page to help you create your classes.
The dungeon maps, the item list, and the enemy list are all read in from text files and
stored in their respective classes (the maps are always 5x5, but do not assume the length
of the enemy or item files).
